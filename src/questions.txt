How many pit voids will remain at closure?
Can you determine the coordinates for each? (Map with locations/where are they?) (note this might need additional info than the mine closure plan if only tenement numbers are given)
How many pits are there that currently have water in them?
How much water is in the pit currently? (depth of water or volume of water)
What is the likelihood that empty pit voids become pit lakes?
How old are the pit voids? (How long since mining ceased for each, or when will it cease?)
How much of the disturbed area of each mine is pit voids? (This could be extended to other types of disturbed area)
What management plans are in place for the pit voids following closure?
Have any environmental risks been identified for any of the pit voids or (future or existing) pit lakes?
Does the mine closure plan identify any knowledge gaps or additional monitoring or trials that are required for successful mine closure?
Has the mine closure plan considered surface water flow and how it will impact post-closure landforms ?
