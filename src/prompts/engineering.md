# Prompt Engineering Instructions for Azure AI Foundry Model

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for crafting effective prompts to interact with the Azure AI Foundry o3-mini model. Proper prompt engineering is crucial for obtaining accurate and relevant responses from the model, especially when analyzing datasets related to "Pit Voids."

## General Guidelines
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want to know. Instead of asking vague questions, provide context and details.
   - Example: Instead of "Tell me about Pit Voids," ask "What are the common causes of Pit Voids in geological surveys?"

2. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid jargon unless necessary. The model performs better with straightforward language.
   - Example: Use "What is the impact of water erosion on Pit Voids?" instead of "How does hydrological activity affect subsurface voids?"

3. **Iterative Refinement**: If the initial response is not satisfactory, refine your prompt based on the model's output.
   - Example: If the model provides a general answer, follow up with "Can you provide specific examples of Pit Voids caused by mining activities?"

4. **Contextual Information**: Provide any relevant background information that may help the model understand the context better.
   - Example: "In the context of urban development, how do Pit Voids affect construction projects?"

5. **Ask for Examples**: When seeking explanations, request examples to clarify complex concepts.
   - Example: "Can you give examples of how Pit Voids have been identified in recent studies?"

## Sample Prompts
- "What methods are used to detect Pit Voids in soil?"
- "Explain the relationship between Pit Voids and groundwater levels."
- "What are the safety concerns associated with Pit Voids in construction sites?"

## Testing and Iteration
- After crafting your prompt, test it with the model and evaluate the response.
- Adjust the prompt based on the clarity and relevance of the output.
- Keep a log of effective prompts and their results for future reference.

## Conclusion
Effective prompt engineering is key to leveraging the capabilities of the Azure AI Foundry model. By following these guidelines, you can enhance the quality of interactions and obtain more useful insights related to "Pit Voids."
